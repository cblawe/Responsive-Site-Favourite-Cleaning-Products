						<p class="img-description">Microfiber cloth is the most important item you need for cleaning. Its versatility and sustainability are some of the many reasons why it's loved by many. They often come in bulk, so you can use them throughout the week and wash them in one load at the end of the week.</p>

						<p class="img-description">A broom and a dustpan are a great combination to keep your floor clean. The frequency of sweeping varies on how easily your home gets dirty, but generally once a day is a good rule of thumb.</p>

						<img src="images/ingredients.jpg" alt="baking soda, vinegar, and dawn dish soap" class="feature-image"> 
						<p class="img-description">Baking soda, vinegar, and dawn dish soap are ingredients I use to clean my entire home. I like to mix vinegar, dawn dish soap, and water in a spray bottle and use it to wipe any surface area. For grease and stain, I like to mix baking soda and water until it turns into a paste consitency, spread it onto the surface, and let it sit for some time before scrubbing the surface clean.</p>

						<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91ILmoy8vaL._AC_SX679_.jpg" alt="shark vacuum" class="feature-image">  
						<p class="img-description">I always prefer corded vacuum cleaners to the cordless ones because they simply have more sucking power than the latter. I really love this particular vacuum by Shark as it effortlessly picks up any dust, hair, fur, crumbs, you name it.</p>

						<p class="img-description">I came across the world of steam cleaning when I first became a homeowner. I wanted my new-to-me home to be spotless and sanitized. It cleans grouts very well and this particular one comes with different attachments, making it super versatile if you don't wanna use any chemicals to clean your home.</p>
